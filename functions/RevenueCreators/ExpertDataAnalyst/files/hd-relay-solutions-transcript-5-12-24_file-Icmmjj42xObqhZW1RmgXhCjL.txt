0:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Hey Tanya.

0:02 - Tanya Valdez
  Hey Ben, how's it going?

0:04 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  How are you?

0:05 - Tanya Valdez
  I am doing pretty well. Yeah, just got back from New York. So just back into it.

0:11 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Okay. Just a little personal trip and some fun.

0:16 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah. Yeah, just wanted to, we haven't seen the great Gatsby yet.

0:19 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  And that was one of the new plays and we're really excited about it. Nice. How was it?

0:25 - Tanya Valdez
  It was good.

0:25 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  And then are you a Potter as a kid, but I read like the first five or six books with my daughter until, you know, started smoking cigarettes and then I hit the pause button.  But yes, I am a Harry Potter fan.

0:40 - Tanya Valdez
  Well, okay. So even as a later Harry Potter fan, I'm sure you can appreciate like seeing Daniel Radcliffe live in person.  I didn't know how hard I would fan girl, but I did it. Yeah, it broke me for a minute.

0:55 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  I got emotional for a second. And was like, my God. I see a hair.

0:59 - Tanya Valdez
  Which one is that? I hear you. Yeah, Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter, and he didn't know he sang, but he was in Merrily We Roll Along for one of the Broadway plays that we saw.

1:10 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Wow, that's cool.

1:11 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, it was, yeah, he has some good pipes on him.

1:14 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  pretty good. Very neat. Oh, all right. Hold on, my PDM is chatting to your...

1:25 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, yeah.

1:47 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yes, we're hitting the pause button on our essentials on boarding. I am 100% convinced that Foundations is going to lead to a mountain of churn.  It is just not the right way to onboard a company to hub spot at any point. And like we came out with a competing SKU called Essentials and it's just like we're doing three of them right now.  And it is not nearly enough help that these companies and they're getting frustrated and we're upselling them. like it's not good to buy something and thinking that's going to solve what you need and then have to buy something more.  So just thinking through all this, what are your thoughts?

2:36 - Tanya Valdez
  I mean, it would still be great if there was an option like an in-between, something above the $600 price point that's maybe under $1,000 that could still give them a little more time or a little more support.  It's so exciting when I have that price point to work off of. But at the end of the day, they're going to be...  the customers that you have and you could say $50 and they'd be like, well, you know, so I understand if you have to go up a bit, but it's still very cool to have you as a lever as an option that that's going to be under $3,000 like, hey, like, we can still do this for you at this price point and it's just right.

3:19 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  No, I hear you. I hear you for sure. Just got to solve for the customer, right? That's what have to orient around.  If they need more help, it's just, you know, not saying you or anybody on your team, but, you know, I think a lot of reps are just hitting the easy button and defaulting to this without any regard to whether it's the right offering for the customer.

3:43 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, I think the ones that I've looked at for that are like, you know, it's like one person, one or two people, and then it's like, okay, well, maybe that's the route we go because your budget is $50 and your dead set on trying figure it out yourself.

3:59 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  That's right. Right. Absolutely. That does make sense. But it's like when they get in there and they actually need more help.

4:06 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah.

4:07 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  It's, you know, it's just, yeah. you know, hopefully it doesn't lead to churn, but that's my, that's my prediction.

4:16 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah. No, that makes sense. Can I ask you, are you guys putting in an immediate pause? Like, should I know this for like, at the end of May, or is this a right now thing?

4:26 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Oh, for essentials, we're hitting pause right now.

4:28 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah.

4:29 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  That's enough. But, you know, that's not saying we're not doing any new deals, just not the $600 ones right now.  We just, we want to wrap up the ones we're doing. Understand if this makes sense or what changes we need to make to it.  You know, we might go up to like a $1,000 offering that just gives a little more help. You know, we'll see.

4:53 - Tanya Valdez
  We'll see. Yeah.

4:56 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Well, all right.

4:57 - Tanya Valdez
  Where is Chelsea? Yeah. Yeah. Let me give her a call real quick.

5:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Let me see if I can get up. You You

6:00 - Tanya Valdez
  You Okay, no, look getting her on the phone let me try to send me to I can shoot a quick note.  Okay. You I know that Rick had mentioned that the call went really well, I honestly haven't had the chance to review it.

7:14 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  I've been still catching up, but did you get a pretty good vibe from like the engagement from her? Give me once I have a new submission of this.  What was your question?

7:38 - Tanya Valdez
  Oh, I just wanted to see if you got like a pretty good vibe from her and like the engagement was good.

7:44 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah, yeah, it was really good. And the sales guy John obviously has a lot more knowledge and experience and context having worked at the company for like 17 years.  And the owner is, you know, you're typical visionary. So kind of like has them running around from, you know, different points when he gets new ideas.  He runs another company that actually manufactures the hardware, the camera hardware, and sells that to other companies, including to competitors of HD relay, which is interesting.

8:22 - Tanya Valdez
  You can see, yeah.

8:24 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  You know, so it's really been a sales led organization. And they're really strong with a couple industries, resorts, golf courses, and ski resorts.  They're not as strong in other areas. management for municipalities is one that they're pretty strong, but like cameras for construction worksites, not so strong.  their website is just super. archaic and is not at all telling the right story. yeah, Chelsea was super engaged, but is really new.  And then John, you know, was also very engaged and really wants more qualified so he doesn't have to drum up everything through prospecting, outbound.  And, you know, is a more sensible, rational person to let them Chelsea in right now.

9:27 - Tanya Valdez
  Perfect.

10:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Can you hear me? Loud and clear, how are you Chelsea?

10:02 - ChelseaJohnson
  Hello?

10:03 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Can you hear us? Can you hear us?

10:15 - ChelseaJohnson
  us?

10:18 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Tommy, you can still hear me right?

10:19 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, yeah, no, I can hear. Yeah, Chelsea, we could hear you, but if it's still giving you me. Yeah, we can hear you.

10:30 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Can you hear us?

10:39 - Tanya Valdez
  No. hear you. Well, I mean, at least you're showing up.

10:57 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  That's good. Good sign. Yeah. All right, letting her back in now.

11:03 - Tanya Valdez
  Okay. All right.

11:56 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Hello. Hey, can you hear us now?

11:58 - 16192708404
  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. So like, something came up.

12:02 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Oh, no, not at all.

12:04 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, I'm glad we made some projects for being patient. Of course.

12:09 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Absolutely. All right. So, Tani, have you met Chelsea before, or is this the first time?

12:13 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, no, we've definitely met. And we got to hop on the first call together. But I know that this call, I believe, was just going to be going over just more in depth and giving Chelsea a little more visual into the tool.

12:28 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Chelsea, how are you feeling after our last call last week?

12:34 - 16192708404
  Oh, was good. Yeah, and I appreciate all the information and all your feedback on everything of our company and everything, and the demo and everything.

12:46 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  So it was really good. Awesome. And it sounded like John was also excited about this.

12:51 - 16192708404
  think he is. Yeah. Unfortunately, he's humble, not unfortunately, but he's in Europe, so he can't be on his call.  Good for him. I'd rather be there. I don't understand. Yeah, otherwise he would be on this call.

13:10 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Very good. So I thought we could start by just recapping the meeting last week and then just better defining like what the scope of the project is and then Tonya and I could go into sharing our screens and given some visual around that scope.  Does that work for you?

13:29 - 16192708404
  Yeah, that's good.

13:31 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Awesome.

13:32 - 16192708404
  And do you have any questions that you want to get addressed during this chat as well? Anything else in your mind?  I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but maybe some questions will come up as we go through the meeting.

13:45 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Okay. Very good. So, yeah, just to recap. I learned quite bit last week. relay has been around a while, is owned by a founder that has another company that actually does the manufacturing of the  video equipment that you sell. And also happens to sell two competitors, which is an interesting dynamic there. You know, out of all the industries that HD relay serves, golf and skiing resorts are the best fit.

14:19 - 16192708404
  Right. think so. I mean, we have the most like ski resorts. So, but we're also trying to get into the space of like the resorts and, you know, the golf, more golf resorts and, I don't know, maybe even amusement parks.  don't know. I'm pretty much anything. Right. can, you know, bring in sales and everything. So, right.

14:44 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  And, you know, it's really any, any place that benefits from having a live video stream of what they do on site, on their website, right, from a marketing and sales standpoint.

14:53 - 16192708404
  Right.

14:54 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Exactly. Yeah. But when we look at other applications like live video footage and recording of of construction sites, right?  There's a lot more that goes into that offering.

15:04 - 16192708404
  Yeah. That you have. That is true, yeah. I mean, we're trying to get into that space, and we have a trade show coming up next January.  So we are trying to move forward into that area.

15:22 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  OK. Well, very good. then the other things that we discussed is the website is really not working from a marketing standpoint, right?  No.

15:31 - 16192708404
  A lot of traffic is going there, it's from keywords that aren't really related to doing business with HD relay.

15:37 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  They're more like, oh, me video footage of the beach in San Diego, or things of that nature.

15:44 - 16192708404
  Mm-hmm.

15:46 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  So the real question is, how do we start generating leads that are high quality that can be sent over to John so he doesn't have to rely solely on the outcome prospecting that he's doing, and seemingly doing a really good job at that.

15:59 - 16192708404
  Yeah, exactly.

16:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  yep and then you know the other factor we talked about is your founders will right correct yes yeah so you know we got to justify this project to him and you know looking at it from a phased approach and ensuring we're getting some nice return on the initial investments is gonna be critical to you know helping to scale this out and getting more resources is that fair to say as well that is yeah yeah awesome all right so in terms of like what we talked about for an initial scope you've got some opportunity right I think to optimize a few pages on your site namely the golf course page and the ski resort page and you know I I did even more research on keywords and there's like basically nothing happening like you know I can do more research but like from a keyword standpoint there's not like any keyword  that are obviously being used by people that own ski resorts or marketers at ski resorts to be looking for this type of solution.

17:07 - 16192708404
  But what that caused me to do is go down the path of like, what could they be searching for, right?

17:13 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  So yeah, I did find, you know, search for like marketing golf courses, marketing ski resorts.

17:23 - 16192708404
  Oh, okay. Yeah.

17:25 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  And you know, I think, you know, they're not looking for video solution, but that's something, your solution can help them do that, right?

17:33 - 16192708404
  Yeah.

17:34 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  You know, I think more more work needs to go into, you know, figuring out all those details, but they do appear to be opportunities to use some paid traffic to send qualified people to your site and actually leads with a better optimized landing page.

17:52 - 16192708404
  Yeah, I know that sounds good.

17:54 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Cool. So we can share with you just how that all looks like in HubSpot. HubSpot. people to integrate with AdWords, and we can help you build landing pages and so on and so forth.  All the analytics were able to integrate with Salesforce to send those up all five leads over to Salesforce where John will pick them up.  And then in the meantime, know, there's a great CMS content management system with HubSpot that their user friendly with some guidance posts.  You know, you'd be able to actually build a website by and large with just, you know, clicking and hitting buttons and writing some content, and HubSpot could also help out that content generation as well.  So those are the aspects that we wanted to show you here within HubSpot. Okay.

18:43 - 16192708404
  Does that all work for you? sounds good. Yeah. So you can actually build out your own website. can understand what HubSpot.
  SCREEN SHARING: Daniel started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/NttmvNxBaVx2JzypfoHv_scfhtZ94wof?timestamp=1130.832375

18:52 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Absolutely. Okay. You know, that's something that you could be working on while we're working on the other areas. Likewise.  So I just built on HubSpot, and the theme I would suggest is called Clean Pro, easy. So this is what one of the pages inside of HubSpot looks like.  So if I want to click here and say a lot, right, I can then go ahead and publish that.  And there you go, save a lot of time, right? So it's so easy to edit this thing, it comes with a lot of templates that you can quickly repurpose and put your own branding on and really just get it dialed in for what you need.  So I wanted to share that. Tanya, would you add anything about the CMS?

19:49 - Tanya Valdez
  I mean, really, I would just stress that it is super user friendly. We don't require you to be a coding expert or anything.  We want these tools to be like drag and drop if possible.

20:00 - 16192708404
  and very intuitive so do you get the sense of that like as you're kind of looking over does this feel like yeah use yeah it seems like it's something that's user-friendly I mean as far as I can see I mean I'm just trying to figure it out I guess yeah yeah and we would give you training on this part and you know this would be something that you could work on a little bit over time well we focus on the more immediate objectives of getting some traffic and leading getting captured but yeah it wouldn't take you too long to get a much better website in place there's no doubt about it okay yeah I guess I just haven't or didn't know that has thought could actually do the website you know restructure you know configuration and I thought it had to be you know like a web designer you know in WordPress or something like that gotcha

21:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  No, yeah, HubSpot's got a computing CMS to WordPress, and like I said, super user-friendly, but also powerful and tightly tightly integrated with the CRM as well.

21:14 - 16192708404
  Yeah, I've used WordPress, so I am familiar with that.

21:18 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Okay. good. Yeah, just to give you a sense of what themes are available, where did that go? All right, you know, you've got home pages, and like all of this stuff is configurable, and you can mix and match.  They're all different modules that you can basically drag onto a screen, background video. all plug and play.

21:44 - 16192708404
  Okay.

21:45 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  really neat. So, yeah, we would guide you through that help train you up, and it's something that I would have a lot of confidence in you being able to do for sure.

21:55 - 16192708404
  Yeah.

21:56 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah, I know. It looks kind. Awesome. Have you had any? demo of HubSpot at this point?

22:02 - 16192708404
  I have, yeah, in the very beginning, they went through it to show how it was user-friendly and all the analytics that you guys provide.  I'm trying to think of all of the other things that you guys showed.

22:19 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  But I think it's just the feel-aside, the marketing side.

22:22 - 16192708404
  They were showing images, like GPP, AI, whatever. For content and then the images as well, think Tonya was showing that.

22:37 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  So, yeah, I did see some of the demo of that. OK, awesome. Yeah, so we'll just dig into some of the areas that we would be focusing on with the onboarding project.

22:50 - 16192708404
  We're able to launch ad campaigns through here with Facebook and Google.

22:56 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  My suggestion would be to focus on those keywords. around golf course marketing, know, ski resort marketing. It's not a huge volume of searches, but it doesn't look like there's a lot of competition, which is nice.  And it would be a way to find people that are clearly able to benefit from what you're able to do.  And I'm sure there's other keywords that we can find as well for you to target.

23:23 - 16192708404
  So the ad campaigns, are they kind of to me.

23:37 - Tanya Valdez
  I'm trying to think of my familiarity with MailChimp itself.

23:41 - 16192708404
  I mean, it's basically just sending out like newsletters, and then you have your contact list, then everything is like exported usually from like sales force, and then imported into MailChimp, and then you can create campaigns.

24:00 - Tanya Valdez
  Well, I guess what I would say for that is that we would have more tools than just a MailChimp, but I think that a lot of that core functionality of sending out these letters and stuff, you'll still be able to do all of that.  So you're not going to lose anything.

24:15 - 16192708404
  You would just be gaining more tools. Okay. That's kind of what I was thinking. just wanted to ask.

24:23 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Got it. Yeah. think MailChimp can do ads, right?

24:27 - 16192708404
  just emailing, if I'm not Right. Yeah.

24:30 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  You can do ads as well. Yeah. So like, yeah, like Tony said, a lot more functionality, a lot more benefit with HubSpot, but generally speaking, you can do everything you can do in MailChimp plus a lot more.  So you're able to launch AdWords campaigns in here and build the ads and have all the tracking and the actual contacts that come through, how much you've spent with the Salesforce integration.  can actually go and hold and track what deals are created from that, what the revenue is from an attribution state.  standpoint. So you're able to really provide lot of analytics and justification for the work you're doing for Will and the organization.

25:10 - 16192708404
  Okay.

25:11 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  What questions do you have about this?

25:18 - 16192708404
  I think I guess like, I mean, how does it work with like Google ads, bringing that in there, and then is that like another fee or something as far as like having PPC?  So I guess that's my other question.

25:38 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  I mean, yeah, you would be paying Google for the traffic, right, for the clicks, so that doesn't change. But this functionality that we're looking at here, where all the campaigns are coming in and you can see the cost per contact and money spent, all that is included with marketing up, which you'll be.

25:57 - 16192708404
  Okay, so it's like an organizational tool, I guess.

26:01 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  It's for like building the campaigns, it's for managing them, it's for, know, working on them, all of that. then, you know, you also get help with writing the content as well with content.

26:14 - 16192708404
  Right.

26:15 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  As well.

26:16 - 16192708404
  I'll show you here in a few moments. Something.

26:20 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah, absolutely. Um, you know, from, you know, lead gen standpoint, we're, we're going to want to be doing a lot of landing pages as well.

26:29 - 16192708404
  Um, yeah, under content, we can go to landing pages here.

26:35 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  And I'll just go into a demo account here to show you what that all looks like.

26:40 - 16192708404
  It's going be a moment.

26:41 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Oh, we do have another question.

26:44 - 16192708404
  So as far as like the website, like, would you give like advice as to like what should be changed or anything like that?

26:54 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yes, I would absolutely give you advice and pointers for sure.

26:58 - 16192708404
  Yeah. Um, okay.

27:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  you know, I'd love to have you get going with the even before like redoing the website. think creating a couple landing pages for marketing golf courses and marketing ski resorts and then putting traffic to that.  I think it could really help, right?

27:17 - 16192708404
  mean, the website only leads per month right now, right?

27:21 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  If we double that, that could actually be pretty significant.

27:24 - 16192708404
  If we double that, it's even more secure, right? Yeah, no. mean, it's kind of hard because like, mean, you know, John's obviously a way, but all there's no sales coming in, so that's kind of a problem too.  Right. So yeah, we need some things to obviously, you know, feed into our our sales, you know, as far as like qualified leads and, I don't know, just, I guess, getting

28:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  as well. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, you know, with that clean theme I showed you, there's a bunch of landing page templates that you can quickly repurpose, plug your content in there and be up and running.  So like a lot of the stuff can be done pretty quickly and then you just collect the data and you figure out what to do next and we'll be walking you through that whole process and helping you out with that.  Here's an example landing page template, right? We've got a nice form here, top right, we've got a background video, which could be one of your videos.  All this content can be edited, modules on here, and it would be a page specific for the keywords that you're advertising to.

28:45 - 16192708404
  Right, I think.

28:47 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah, absolutely. like my suggestion would be get going on this as soon as possible.

28:54 - 16192708404
  Well, you're building a website. Right, no, that makes sense. mean. We need to start as soon as possible, so get something going.

29:05 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Right, absolutely. you know, moving forward here, you know, perhaps like early next week or mid next week, but there's still a good chance to get some progress done before John gets back as well.

29:17 - 16192708404
  Yeah. Yeah. I think so. So I guess, like, I mean, going forward, like, what would be the next step, just so we know?

29:31 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Well, in terms of, we want to just run through, like, this demo and make sure what we're talking about in the scope of the onboarding is in line with what you're expecting.  then at that point, think, yeah, to pricing and getting you to sell it internally.

29:49 - 16192708404
  Yeah, no, that's on spot on.

29:50 - Tanya Valdez
  So we'll finish this up and then I'll just kind of recap pricing for you guys. I mean, we'd love to get you started and I think it's a great idea to say done before he gets back.

30:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  are people.

30:01 - 16192708404
  I appreciate it.

30:05 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  We don't need to get into this, but super important for John, Having the integration between HubSpot and Salesforce, that would be what you've got.  Tiny, is this part of OpsHub or is this included with the marketing hub?

30:19 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah, they have it in the professional tier of the Salesforce integration.

30:23 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Beautiful. Okay, that's what I thought I just wanted to make sure. My team and I will help get this set up and we're able to sync that by directionally between HubSpot and Salesforce.  Tiny qualified leads that you generate from the marketing side, get sent over to Salesforce where John does what he does with sales and then when that deal ultimately closes, HubSpot will be aware of that and then you can attribute that sale to the marketing that generated the lead in the first place.

30:51 - 16192708404
  Okay.

30:53 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah, I think he definitely would need that.

31:00 - 16192708404
  That would be really helpful.

31:01 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah. And then I think one of the main things that we want to show you from this point on is just the content remix.  So, Tonya, going to go ahead and stop sharing here and let you dig into that one.
  SCREEN SHARING: Tanya started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/NttmvNxBaVx2JzypfoHv_scfhtZ94wof?timestamp=1875.635996

31:12 - Tanya Valdez
  Thank you. Let me grab that screen. Okay. We may have gone over this a little bit. We're just going to do a quick read for it, but the content of course, I just want to make sure that you know how easy it is.  And I think that's a big point of this. We just want to make it really feasible. So this is what content remix looks like.  We made it easy by including these templates here so that you can already have some preset templates of what your ideal marketing campaign would look like.  So in this example here, what I did was I went over to the site. I went ahead and snagged a piece of the blog.  So I just wanted to borrow some content came over here to add content. And you can see that it would just be starting from a new text.  Copy and paste it here. I had it preloaded because as you know, my internet is a iffy at best, but So this is the original text blog.  So this is what we have that we borrowed from you guys But then you can see created a blog post for you We did social we did email and all of this would be in your brand voice So it's not gonna sound like AI it should be sounding more like something you guys would like go and post yourselves And I know you told me that it's responsible for all this so do we think this yeah Yeah, I mean I do need to do I mean I'm in charge of social media for our company So that is something that you know would be helpful and in terms of like you know having it there, you know, right?

32:53 - 16192708404
  you know, know from the content and everything and then being able to I guess you know build upon that I You  So I think that would be really helpful as far as like, you know, building things out for the social.

33:08 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah. You know, my sense is it gets you like 85, maybe even 90% there. And then you just hold time to get it to 100% where you need it to be, right?  Right. know, it's more like an augment and a amplification, not a replacement of what you do at all.

33:26 - 16192708404
  Mm-hmm. So we. Yeah.

33:30 - Tanya Valdez
  Good. Good. With these, I know that we talked about it, but I understand that we were going over a lot last time.  So when we look at marketing and content professional, we're at 1390 and for next steps, we'd be looking at getting quote sent out.  And as long as you carry through with the activation link, we should be able to have you up and going almost straight away of Dan, do you have availability to like kind of go ahead and like start working or.  What are you thinking for, like, being able to do a first meet?

34:03 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah. No, we can get going really as early as next week, so that wouldn't be a problem. And I'll need to get you a quote over beyond boarding piece.  So, you know, there's like three flavors for how we on board customers to help spot one would be like we're going to teach you how to fish and you're doing all the work in the other would be sort of we're going fishing together and we're helping you.  Yeah. We might do a few things and then the third would be like we're doing all the work for you and give you the delicious cooked salmon on a silver platter.  Right. Which one works best for you?

34:42 - 16192708404
  Um, I guess like just, I mean, as far as like working together and then being able to build it out together, I think that would be helpful.  Okay. As far as like, you know, so we're kind of cohesive, you know, and are, you know, what we're presenting.  Yeah. Yeah. I think that would be beneficial. So you're saying it would be 1390 monthly?

35:09 - Tanya Valdez
  Yes.

35:10 - 16192708404
  And then another fee for, I guess, for Daniel as far as like what he's doing as well or the onboarding part.

35:19 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Correct. That's correct.

35:21 - 16192708404
  Yeah.

35:22 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  you know, that would be like a range of, I need to look at it a little more detail and just look at the areas that we would be doing versus you doing.

35:30 - 16192708404
  But, you know, I'm like $2,700 to $3 The $2,700 to $3,700. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm going to have to like, yeah, get back to you on that.  It seems little higher than our budget that we have. So, yeah, that's only thing I'm running into right now.  Okay. Okay.

36:00 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.

36:00 - 16192708404
  the I can see. So, um, if you could just have that, um, I'm sorry, um, it would be possible just to send me an email with all of your costs as far as like, you know, um, what we would need to pay upfront and everything.

36:18 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Well, yeah, absolutely.

36:19 - 16192708404
  would send you a call. Okay. Yeah.

36:24 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  what do you have a budget, a number in mind that is within your budget?

36:29 - 16192708404
  Um, I'm trying to think. I mean, I think that's our problem is that like the 1390 is, you know, quite a bit for us.  So like, you know, because we still have sales force as well. And then adding on the 2,700 to 3,700, um, is kind of putting it, you know, in a higher bracket.  So, um, like, I mean, it's kind of hard because it's it's, it's, it's, has not given me a budget for this so I'm kind of just like thinking you know on my own as to what we have going on um so yeah I guess I mean I should have got had more information from him as far as you know what he thought our budget would should be um for this so I think that's I get I just think like it's a little bit like a sticker price shock you know so I think that's what it is so um but I mean I understand like you know you guys are providing you know a service and everything and you know um you know it is costly so um I think that I will just need to like I got to talk to him more about you know cost and see where he's at and then if you have your numbers then maybe we can come to some kind of agreement um do you know when you would be able to have a conversation with him?

38:00 - Tanya Valdez
  I'm so you can get more of a feel for what he's allocating for this.

38:04 - 16192708404
  Um, probably the, I mean, this week, so I'll be able to talk to him about it.

38:10 - Tanya Valdez
  Okay. What, what maybe we could try to do, because I do want to make sure that we help you as much as we can for this, um, um, well, let me ask you this.  If you're going to be able to meet with him this week, do you think that you guys have a decision by Friday?

38:27 - 16192708404
  I think so.

38:28 - Tanya Valdez
  Yeah. Okay. If you can get a decision by Friday, um, do you think that we would be able to like hop on a call with him and kind of go over this so that, because, you know, it's kind of hard to have value translated if you don't get the job with somebody and I know, no, I understand.  Yeah, because you're, you're trying to make a message, but I know it's hard, because it's new for you too.

38:52 - 16192708404
  Should we, should we have a call so we can go with it? problem is, is he's not that available, but, um, so he got  kind of basically says like set up the meeting, and then if I'm available, I'm available.

39:05 - Tanya Valdez
  Oh, okay.

39:06 - 16192708404
  yeah, so it makes it kind of difficult. So, but I mean, I can talk to him and see if there is any time that he would want to, you know, I guess sit in on the call or, I don't know, but I mean, basically I'm just trying to do the research and then present it to him and then see where we can go.  Okay.

39:30 - Tanya Valdez
  From there. Well, yeah, I mean, I know I know it kind of gives you like, you know, not that great of an understanding of what's going on or, you know, his side of it.  So, I understand that that part's difficult as well. No, I totally get it. I mean, I just, again, I just want to see how we can best support you, but it is harder if it's a little more hectic, so I get that.

39:56 - 16192708404
  Well, what we get is the three companies.

40:00 - Tanya Valdez
  So he's just. is pulled in every direction?

40:01 - 16192708404
  Yeah, pretty much.

40:04 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  But he basically said he wants this business to grow, right?

40:10 - 16192708404
  He does.

40:11 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  He does. Yeah. And the current set up, the current state, it's not happening at this point. So I think if we could just, you know, get one call with him, we will help you sell this thing and hear him out and really align with us to see happen with HubSpot as a solution to help him get there.  you know, you're getting quite a bit of value, right? You're able to get a website. You're able to do marketing.  able to manage ads. You know, you're able to integrate that with sales force, right?

40:46 - 16192708404
  with what you're already doing.

40:47 - Daniel Kurt (revenuecreators.com)
  Right. There's quite a bit there that's going to help him achieve his objective of growing this and, you know, sales.  So I think we can really help you sell it. If we can just get a little time with them.

40:59 - 16192708404
  Yeah. I completely understand and I agree. Yeah. Let me try and talk to him and see where he's at.
